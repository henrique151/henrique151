## About Me:
<div>
   <p align="start">
     Hi! My name is Henrique, I'm 18 years old and I graduated in Systems Development from Etec da Leste. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Multiplatform Software Development at FATEC. I've been passionate about technology since I was a child, which led me to pursue a career in IT. I have experience with both back-end and front-end development, although I prefer back-end. I am constantly improving my skills and learning new technologies.
<br /><br />
     I started my journey in development at the age of 15, and since then I have been fascinated by the impact technology has on the world. From early computers to quantum chips and advances in healthcare, technology always impresses me. My interest in the field has only grown, motivating me to deepen my knowledge and explore new opportunities to understand how technology works and how it can be applied.
<br /><br />
     I am communicative, enjoy problem-solving, and take my responsibilities seriously. As a recent graduate, I focus on developing projects that solve real-world problems. My goal is to specialize in Artificial Intelligence, studying Python and other tools. In the long term, I aim to work in AI and expand my experience internationally. Meanwhile, I continue to strengthen my skills through projects and seeking internship or job opportunities. I have a solid foundation in Java, JavaScript, and MySQL, as well as experience with Laravel, Node.js, TypeScript, ReactJS, React Native, and Firebase. Check out my projects!
